# STEPPER-MOTOR-CONTROL

 * In this project the stepper motor is used to contorl and interface with the AVR Microcontroller.
 
## INSTALLATION SOFTWARES

 * CODE BLOCKS.
 * SIMULIDE.
 * GitHub desktop.

## PROCEDURE

  * Here we are going to interface 6 wires Unipolar Stepper Motor with ATmega32 controller.
  * Only four wires are required to control the stepper motor. 
  * Two common wires of stepper motor connected to 5V supply.
  * ULN2803 driver is used to the driving stepper motor.
  * ATmega32 to rotate the stepper motor 360° clockwise by half step sequence and 360° anticlockwise by full step sequence.
  
## TESTING AND CODING
 
 * Preferable Coding Software for Avr Coding is Microchip studio.
 * You have to use C compiler with MINGGW(latest or the previous versions).
 * Set path for MINGGW in Environment variables.
 * To go with best compiler use CODE BLOCKS.
 * In CODE BLOCKS you can also RUN the program in both LINUX and WINDOWS.
